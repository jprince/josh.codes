    "problem": "A patient's healthcare information is typically fragmented across several different systems. Primary care physicians, hospitals, and specialists each have their own record management system and these systems rarely exchange data with one another. This makes it difficult for healthcare providers to have a comprehensive picture of a patient and their overall wellness.",
    "solution": "Arcadia Analytics aggregates data from these disparate source systems and provides clients with a single system of record. The tool is used for measuring quality of care provided, prioritizing patient outreach, coordinating care, and analyzing utilization and cost of services.",

    "solution": "Kanburn provides a burndown for projects that utilize a Kanban or continuous flow planning process. It takes inputs for team size, velocity, and PTO and uses them, along with estimates on open tickets pulled from the JIRA API, to provide a real-time estimate of the release's completion date.
